            <p>
               This is the only dipping sauce you need. Fullstop. If you only remember one thing its this. I used this for dipping, for salads as a dressing, for a marinate, its just the best.
               
                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Seaseme Oil</li>
                    <li>Soya Sauce</li>
                    <li>Vinegar</li>
                    <li>Honey</li>
                    <li>(optional) Chilly flakes</li>
                </ul>
    
                <h2>Method</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Dump it all into a bowl and mix. </li>
                    <p> I'm not joking its that simple. This is a really forgiving dressing and will always turn out fine. Fancy it up for more flavour but you'll never want to because its just so balanced already!!</p>
                </ol>
