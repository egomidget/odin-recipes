            Bacon pancakes are tasty and not good for you. Who doesn't love that. I always suggest investing in good maple syrup over better bacon. you can pretend the pork is better, but you cannot pretend the syrup doesn't taste like plastic.
            Also if you do not have bacon, abit of fried ham always works in a pince - I do this more often then I would like when i just want quick pancakes :DD!!
